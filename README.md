### Documentation for **Task Priority Manager**

---

#### **Introduction**
The **Task Priority Manager** is a simple Java-based console application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently using a priority-based system. It leverages a min-heap data structure implemented via Java's `PriorityQueue` class to organize tasks based on their priority levels. This ensures that tasks requiring immediate attention are handled first.

#### **What It Can Do**
1. **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a name and an associated priority level. Lower numbers represent higher priority.
2. **View Highest-Priority Task**: The application can display the task that currently has the highest priority.
3. **Complete Tasks**: The highest-priority task can be marked as completed and removed from the queue.
4. **List All Tasks**: Displays all pending tasks along with their priorities.
5. **Exit**: Users can exit the application at any time.
