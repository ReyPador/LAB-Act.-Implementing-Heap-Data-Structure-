### Documentation for **Task Priority Manager**

---

#### **Introduction**
The **Task Priority Manager** is a simple Java-based console application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently using a priority-based system. It leverages a min-heap data structure implemented via Java's `PriorityQueue` class to organize tasks based on their priority levels. This ensures that tasks requiring immediate attention are handled first.

#### **What It Can Do**
1. **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a name and an associated priority level. Lower numbers represent higher priority.
2. **View Highest-Priority Task**: The application can display the task that currently has the highest priority.
3. **Complete Tasks**: The highest-priority task can be marked as completed and removed from the queue.
4. **List All Tasks**: Displays all pending tasks along with their priorities.
5. **Exit**: Users can exit the application at any time.

#### **Why This Application?**
I made this application to practice and apply my understanding of heap data structures in a real-world scenario. I wanted to create something that could be useful for organizing tasks and priorities efficiently, and using a heap structure seemed like a great way to do that. A priority queue allows me to ensure that the most important tasks are always handled first, which is a feature I think is valuable for personal task management.

This application contributes to me by improving my skills in Java and understanding how data structures like heaps can be used practically. It also gives me a way to better manage my tasks by focusing on priorities, making my day more organized and productive. For the community, it offers an easy-to-understand example of how heap structures work, which can help students and developers better grasp this concept and apply it in their own projects.
